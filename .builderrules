# Builder.io Projects Rules

# Project-wide guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all components and utilities
- Follow React functional component patterns with hooks
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling with utility classes
- Add JSDoc comments to all exported functions and components
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for all props

# Component structure
- Place components in src/components/{ComponentName}.tsx
- Export components from index files when appropriate
- Use proper prop validation with TypeScript
- Follow the existing Hero component pattern for Builder.io integration

# Styling guidelines
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for all styling

# Builder.io integration
- Register all custom components with builder.registerComponent()
- Use proper input types for Builder.io component configuration
- Include sensible default values for all component inputs
- Import component registrations in BuilderPage.tsx

# Code organization
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use proper file naming conventions (PascalCase for components)
- Organize imports: React first, then third-party, then local
- Use absolute imports with @/ prefix for local modules

# Performance
- Use React.memo() for components that don't need frequent re-renders
- Implement proper key props for list items
- Optimize images and assets
- Use Next.js Image component for all images
